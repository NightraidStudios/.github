## Nightraid Studios

### Origin

Nightraid Studios is an upcoming game development company currently in the works. We are constantly updating our repositories and learning new tricks of the trade. We operate mainly on discord but will be starting a slack and teamspeak server as well. Most of our member base operates in the united states, but we believe that members should be chosen on pure tenacity.

### Experience
Some of the languages we use are PHP, Java, C#, HTML, and Javascript.
Some of the frameworks we use are ASP.NET, Laravel, Bootstrap, Entity Framework, and Dapper.

You can find our discord server [here](https://discord.nightraid.studio/)
